My creative interests in sparking this Global initiative is 1st my love for humanity. All languages understand love when they see this ‚ù§Ô∏è. As my quantum physics friends surely agree the universe rains diamonds we see as this üíé yet the universe sees this all perfect circle, in numbers is 12, the perfect ocatave of love in music, the beautiful colors of the color wheel, and actual physically experiencing a phenom called a Quark has inspired this README for the world. Sound quarky? It probably looks and feels quarky too while you README. Continuing on the 1st preperation in this playbook is GLOBAL12. A 12 piece art collection to honor 12 countries around the world. These pieces will not be sold. Not only honoring countries truly but also recruiting Globally 12 great minds in the process. No specific qualifications I just want to take my time and as I market Globally helping boost tourism as a token of my love for these countries. All my books are hand written non published collections i pull from for new ideas. About me I have a degree in Science , I work for an Engineering team and genuinely love my job. Im very interested in study of colors, the chemical Og on the PTE, the creation of energy in a 4th dimensional spin.
